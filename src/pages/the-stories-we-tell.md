We like to tell stories

Programmers will tell you over and over naming is hard.

We'd like to give abstract entities names, so that we can remember their context.

I remember back in 2011 telling my journalism professor that I should probably use 'Kamal'. It might be easier.

He disagreed. They'll remember, he said.

It's not easy, but people certainly don't forget 'Harkanwal' if they manage to remember it.

Some however don't. When I was working for Stuff.co.nz/Waikato Times, I was given the nickname 'Harkie'.

In case you feel an urge to shout that name in public, let me assure you I probably will turn around, we might have a polite conversation. But we won't become friends, ever.
